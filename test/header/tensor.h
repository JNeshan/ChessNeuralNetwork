//The tensor class wraps a pointer to a contiguous array with data to represent it as an n-dimensional matrix, along with
//handling the allocation, destruction, and transfer of memory in the CPU and GPU
//The dimensions and overall size are necessary to perform the Cuda computations, and the dimension count n is needed to
//enforce constraints for a layer that expects an input tensor with specific dimensions (i.e. convolution using 4, dense using 2)
//Reshape can freely modify dimensions and n as long as size remains the same, since its encapsulating the data but with a different
//split.
//NOTE: Tensor will always pad dimensions to be at least size 4. This is essential since cudnn tensor descriptors require 4
//dimension inputs, so by padding dimensions with 1, which keeps size the same, and using n to recall the actual dimensionality,
//the descriptor calls can always use the four indices of dimensions. This just makes it much simpler.
//
//Tensors have their data including their sizes, dimensionality, and array data stored into binary files. They are written to the immediately
//open section so sequential calls to write to the same open file will write them sequentially. As such the read function expects to read
//tensor information from an input file in a very strict order, with it using the data type sizes to move across the data and information like
//size to know how far to extend the float*. As such, the order that the tensors are saved in needs to be maintained across runs, so for the
//overall neural network, a modification to the layers in any form means that the data either needs to be reset, or there needs to be a function
//specifically made to change the structure of layers and maintain the old layers data.
//The main draw from this is that writing and reading must be performed very carefully.
